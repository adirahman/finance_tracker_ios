# Finance Tracker

Finance Tracker is a personal finance management app that I developed for my own daily use. I created this app to make use of my old iPhone 6s, which was sitting idle. Rather than letting it go to waste, I decided to repurpose it for daily use while simultaneously learning iOS app development.

## Motivation
Since my iPhone 6s is no longer receiving updates beyond iOS 15.8, I wanted to build a simple finance tracking app tailored to my needs. This project serves as both a practical tool for managing my personal finances and a learning experience for developing iOS applications.

## Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI**: I chose SwiftUI because it's a modern framework and I was eager to learn it.
- **UserDefaults**: Since SwiftData requires a minimum of iOS 17 and my iPhone 6s is limited to iOS 15.8, I opted for UserDefaults. Given that the stored data is simple and does not require complex data management, UserDefaults is a suitable choice.

## Features
- Add and categorize daily expenses
- View a summary of expenses
- Simple and lightweight UI optimized for personal use

## Future Plans
- Enhance UI/UX for a smoother user experience
- Explore data visualization for spending trends

## Installation
Currently, this app is developed for personal use and is not available on the App Store. However, if you wish to run it on your own device, you can clone the repository and build it using Xcode.

## Conclusion
This project has been a great way for me to explore SwiftUI and reinforce my iOS development skills. It also demonstrates how an old device can still be useful with a custom-built application. I'm excited to continue improving and learning from this experience.
